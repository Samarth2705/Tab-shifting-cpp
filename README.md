Tab Shifting Algorithm in C++

A C++ program that demonstrates tab shifting (reordering) using Data Structures.
This project simulates how tabs (like browser/editor tabs) can be shifted left or right efficiently using logical operations.

🚀 Features

Shift tabs left or right
Dynamic tab management
Efficient reordering logic
Uses C++ Standard Library
Clean and readable implementation
Beginner-friendly & DSA-oriented

🛠️ Technologies Used

C++
Data Structures (Arrays / Queues / Linked Lists – based on implementation)
Standard Template Library (STL)

🧠 Concept Used

Index manipulation
Data shifting logic
Looping & condition handling
Memory-efficient operations

🧪 Example Use Case

Shift open tabs in an editor
Rearrange elements dynamically
Practice array & index manipulation
Understand real-world application of data structures

🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project helps in understanding:
Practical use of Data Structures
Logical problem solving in C++
Index-based shifting algorithms
Writing structured and maintainable C++ code
